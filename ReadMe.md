## 🛠️ Getting Started (For Developers): Ignite Your Bot 🔥💻

Ready to dive into the codebase and contribute to the evolution of ForexSignalBot? Follow these comprehensive steps to set up the project locally. Our development philosophy emphasizes a `dotnet ducker` approach 🐳, ensuring consistent, isolated, and highly reproducible development environments across various machines. 🚀


## 🚀 Getting Started with Docker

This project is fully containerized using **Docker Compose**. This is the recommended way to run the application for development, as it automatically sets up the .NET application and the SQL Server database in an isolated environment.

You do **not** need to install the .NET SDK or SQL Server on your machine.

### Prerequisites

All you need is **Docker Desktop** installed and running on your system.
-   [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Windows, Mac, and Linux)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get the source code onto your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Opselon/ForexTradingBot.git
cd ForexTradingBot
```

### 2. Configure Your Secrets

The application requires secret keys (like API tokens and passwords) to run. These are managed in a local `.env` file that is kept private and is not checked into Git.

A template file named `.env.example` is provided for you.

-   **Automatic Setup (Recommended):** Simply run the startup script for your operating system. It will create the `.env` file for you if it doesn't exist.
-   **Manual Setup:** If you prefer, you can manually copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and fill in your actual secret values.

### 3. Run the Application! 🔥

With Docker running and your `.env` file configured, you can start the entire application stack with a single command.

-   **On Windows:** Double-click the `start.bat` file.
-   **On Linux or macOS:** Open a terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    # Make the script executable (only need to do this once)
    chmod +x start.sh

    # Run the script
    ./start.sh
    ```

**That's it!** The script will:
1.  Build the .NET application's Docker image.
2.  Download and start a SQL Server container.
3.  Start your application container.
4.  Connect everything on a private network.
5.  Your application, if configured with Entity Framework, will automatically apply database migrations on startup.

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080` shortly.

### Managing Your Application

-   **View real-time logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`
-   **Stop the application:** `docker-compose down`
-   **Connect to the Database (Optional):** You can connect to the SQL Server instance running in Docker using any database tool (like Azure Data Studio or SSMS).
    -   **Server:** `localhost,1433` (You may need to uncomment the ports line in `docker-compose.yml` for the `db` service first)
    -   **Authentication:** SQL Login
    -   **User:** `sa`
    -   **Password:** The `DB_SA_PASSWORD` you set in your `.env` file.



1.  **Clone the repository:** Initiate the development process by cloning the project's source code from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Opselon/ForexTradingBot.git
    cd ForexTradingBot
    ```
    *This command fetches the code to your local machine.* ⬇️

2.  **Database Setup (PostgreSQL):** ForexSignalBot utilizes PostgreSQL 🐘 for its robust data persistence layer.
    *   Ensure that a PostgreSQL instance is installed, configured, and actively running on your local system or accessible via your network. ✅
    *   Update the `DefaultConnection` string within your `appsettings.json` file (or `appsettings.Development.json` for local development configurations) to correctly point to your operational PostgreSQL instance, including credentials. 🔑
    *   Apply the necessary Entity Framework Core migrations to initialize and update the database schema to the latest version:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef database update --project Infrastructure --startup-project WebAPI
        ```
        *This sets up your database tables.* 🏗️
    *   **Populate RSS Feeds & Categories:** Execute the provided `Populate_RssSources_Categories.sql` script (located in the project root, or execute it directly from your SQL client) against your database. This crucial one-time step will establish the initial categories and populate the comprehensive list of RSS feeds that the bot aggregates. 📡🔄

3.  **Telegram Bot Token:** For the Telegram bot functionality to operate, it requires an authentication token. 🤖
    *   Obtain a unique bot token by interacting with the official `@BotFather` on Telegram. Follow his instructions to create a new bot and retrieve its token. 🤝
    *   Configure your obtained bot token in the `appsettings.json` file under the `TelegramPanelSettings:BotToken` configuration key. 📝

4.  **Hangfire Dashboard (Optional but Recommended):** Hangfire is used for managing background jobs. ⏱️
    *   Configure your Hangfire dashboard path and security settings as needed within `appsettings.json`. This dashboard provides invaluable insights into job processing, failures, and schedules, which is highly recommended for monitoring background operations. 📊🔍

5.  **Build and Run (.NET):** With all prerequisites configured, build and run the application. 🚀
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run --project WebAPI # Or use your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code) to run the WebAPI project.
    ```
    *This compiles and starts your application.* ⚙️

6.  **Docker Integration (Recommended for Production & Consistency - `dotnet ducker`):** Leveraging Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment, crucial for development and deployment. 🐳
    *   To visually represent your Docker setup, a diagram illustrating the containerized architecture (e.g., showing PostgreSQL, WebAPI, and TelegramPanel services running in separate, interconnected containers) would be beneficial here. **(Placeholder for Docker Architecture Diagram)** 🏗️
    *   Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your machine to orchestrate the containers. ✅
    *   Build and run all services using Docker Compose, which manages multi-container Docker applications:
        ```bash
        docker-compose build
        docker-compose up
        ```
    *   *This command will orchestrate your PostgreSQL database, WebAPI, and TelegramPanel services within isolated Docker containers, guaranteeing a consistent and scalable development/production environment from the outset, embodying the "dotnet ducker" philosophy.* 🚀📦
