// File: Infrastructure/Services/RssReaderService.cs
// Version: 2.0 (Hyper-Verbose Enterprise Edition)
// Last Updated: [Current Date]
// Description: An extremely detailed, robust, and resilient implementation for fetching,
//              processing, and dispatching RSS feed news items. This version prioritizes
//              diagnostics, configurability, and maintainability.
